### Ulord Technical Features  
#### Multi-sidechain technology  
By multi-sidechain technology, we can make digital assets transfering between different chains, and the Ulord's transaction performance, security and privacy have all been improved. Multi-sidechain technology makes Ulord easily intergrate the latest blockchain technology. Sidechain can also issue their own Token and freely combine smart contracts, micro-payments and other functions.
#### Mixed consensus mechanism  
Ulord uses the mixed consensus mechanism of PoW and PoS. PoW is a CPU wide algorithm for anti-risc mining rigs. Users who provide storage and bandwidth for Ulord will receive rewards from PoS.   
#### Master node system  
Master node system helps to ensure the network stability. Master node users can vote on the teams and projects participating in Ulord ecological construction. They can review the content on Ulord and promote the orderly development of Ulord ecological health. The master node is also the infrastructure for decentralized storage networks.  
#### Decentralized storage system  
Ulord builds a decentralized storage system based on hash content addressing to form a robust Ulord content storage distribution network with PoS incentive and master node mechanism.
####  Smart contract  
Ulord is compatible with Ethereum smart contract to reduce developer learning costs. Smart contract with turing complete brings more possibilities to Ulord.  
#### AI algorithm  
Ulord pushes the comprehensive knowledge structure features, theme features, and semantic features through AI, and realizes content smart push with different dimensions to different users based on user data and behavioral data.
#### Digital content self-purification and maintenance  
Ulord uses the voting mechanism and the AI content intelligence verification mechanism to calculate, analyze and filter content originality, sensitivity and quality.  
####  Instant payment  
Through the master node system, Ulord can support more than 4000 transactions per second to meet the demand of practical application better.
